2003-09-01  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.04

	* dialog.py: Replaced the apply() calls with calls using the
	"extended call syntax" since apply() is deprecated since the
	release of Python 2.3.

2002-09-05  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.03.

	* dialog.py: Reorganized the documentation between the module's
	docstring and that of the Dialog class.

	* README: Added the "history" section and other improvements.

2002-09-04  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Prefixed global variables with an underscore and
	made some cosmetic fixes.

	* dialog.py: Removed the set_background_title alias to
	setBackgroundTitle since nobody uses it yet and setBackgroundTitle
	is obsolete. Even though I prefer set_background_title to
	setBackgroundTitle for consistency with other methods, there is no
	point in adding an obsolete method.

2002-09-03  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Packaged pythondialog with Distutils.

	* Improved the README.

2002-09-02  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Improved the common_args_syntax initialization so
	that simple dialog Common Options can be passed as foo=1 keyword
	arguments with 1 having a real boolean meaning (was not the case
	before).

	* Handled the licensing stuff : GNU LGPL license for dialog.py and
	public domain for demo.py. Added the COPYING file.

	* dialog.py: Wrote a proper module docstring.

	* demo.py: Added the last widgets to the demo.
	
2002-08-30  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Added the calendar, fselect, passwordbox, tailbox and
	timebox widgets.

2002-08-29  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py (_wait_for_program_termination): Raises a DialogError
	exception when dialog returns self.DIALOG_ERROR. Exceptions are so
	handy.

	* demo.py: Cleaned up the demo code making it easier (I hope) to
	focus on a given widget, added error handling.
	* dialog.py: Took the demo to put it in a new, separate file:
	demo.py.
	

2002-08-21  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Documented the widgets properly.
	* dialog.py: Generalized the widgets that didn't offer all the
	capabilities available from dialog.
	* dialog.py: Went through the various widgets so that the
	associated methods return the dialog exit status (with additional
	information, if relevant).

	* dialog.py: Finally cleaned up the method used to collect the
	arguments given to dialog. They are now stored as elements of a
	list and properly quoted to protect them from shell expansion just
	before the call to popen3. Now, you should be safe with any
	character in the strings passed to dialog (labels, texts, etc.).

2002-08-09  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: All boxes should now support the common arguments
	scheme (well, I still have to look at the gauge closer).

	* dialog.py: Added support for "common arguments"; now, you can
	use any combination of the _common options_ for the dialog program
	when creating a box. Example:
	
	   d.checklist(<usual args for a checklist box>,
	               title="...", backtitle="...", <other common args>)

	One thing is still broken: we must shell-escape the strings so
	that apostrophes (') used to delimit shell arguments don't clash
	with apostrophes used these arguments themselves.

	* dialog.py: Added support for "persistent arguments" arguments
	(--backtitle is a good candidate for this).

	* dialog.py: Removed a leftover debugging print in _perform.

	* dialog.py: Simplified the DIALOG* arguments handling.

2002-08-08  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Added a short docstring for the module.

	* dialog.py: Rewrote checklist to get all the features from the
	corresponding option in dialog.

	* dialog.py: Rewrote _perform; now, we can use the DIALOG*
	environment variables set in the constructor, which allows us
	distinguish between ESC pressed and a dialog error, among others;
	also, we use no temporary file anymore to store dialog's stderr.

	* dialog.py: Added some exceptions.

	* dialog.py: Rewrote __init__; now, we can set choose in the
	constructor the DIALOG* environment variables to pass the dialog
	program as well as this program (could be whiptail for instance)
	from the constructor (and the environment variables can be
	different for two Dialog instances used in the same python
	process...).

	* dialog.py: Renamed __foo methods to _foo.

2002-08-07  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Cosmetic fixes.

	* dialog.py: Added a proper GPL header (dialog.py only had a short
	mention about its license being the GNU GPL).

	* Split dialog.py, creating a Changelog file in the format
	described in the GNU Coding Standards, as well as README, AUTHORS,
	COPYING and TODO.

2000-07-30  Sultanbek Tezadov (http://sultan.da.ru/)

	* dialog.py: Added the gauge widget.

	* dialog.py: Added a 'title' option to some widgets.

	* dialog.py: Added a 'checked' option to the checklist dialog;
	clicking "Cancel" is now recognizable.

	* dialog.py: Added a 'selected' option to the radiolist dialog;
	clicking "Cancel" is now recognizable.

	* dialog.py: Some other cosmetic changes and improvements.

2000-??-??  Robb Shecter <robb@acm.org>
