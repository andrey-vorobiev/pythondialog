* Support --help-status; --item-help for more widgets; --output-separator

* Maybe get rid of _create_temporary_directory() in favor of what Python has
  in its stdlib now?

* Try detecting the terminal window size in order to make reasonable height
  and width defaults. Hmmm---should also then check for terminal resizing...

* Support --tailboxbg

* Use height=0 and width=0 for automatic size everywhere?
