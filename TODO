* Add code so that the input buffer is flushed before a dialog box is shown.
  This would make the UI more predictable for users. This feature could be
  turned on and off through an instance method.

  -> Unclear to me (Florent).

* Try detecting the terminal window size in order to make reasonable height
  and width defaults. Hmmm---should also then check for terminal resizing...

* Support --inputmenu, --pause, --progressbox, --tailboxbg

* Use height=0 and width=0 for automatic size everywhere?
