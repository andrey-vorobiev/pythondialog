* Support --help-status and --item-help for more widgets. Good --item-help
  handling requires IMO the --help-tags option added in dialog 1.2-20130902.

* Support for --output-separator.

* Maybe get rid of _create_temporary_directory() in favor of what Python has
  in its stdlib now?

* Try detecting the terminal window size in order to make reasonable height
  and width defaults. Hmmm---should also then check for terminal resizing...

* Support --tailboxbg

* Use height=0 and width=0 for automatic size everywhere?
